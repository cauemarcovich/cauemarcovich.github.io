**Worms Survivor** is a game created for the [**GameDev.tv**][gamedevtv] jam (**2024**).
It was inspired in Rock Harden from Pokemon Stadium.

***

## My Contribution
In this project, I acted as the Lead Developer, handling most of the work and offering guidance to a colleague.
Our team also included two illustrators who enhanced the visual elements of the game.

## Key Features
- Game Flow: Managed game state, win/defeat conditions, and overall game flow
- Gameplay Mechanics of the worms and eagles
- Some animations using DOTween, including those for worms, eagles, UI elements, tutorials, and transitions.
- Art/Audio Implementation
